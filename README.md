# Enigma

This is a pair of addons (Enigma and EnigmaSlave) that communicate using the Battle-net account chat to gather player population information from the enemy faction in real time by automating the /who query in-game.

Unfortunately it has been several years since I last worked on the project and, poking through the code, it appears I did not have the foresight to explain much of it in comments. The addon uses several commonly used addon library files that I have omitted from the repo as this exists more to show the code was written, rather than be a usable addon.

At the time of writing, I have not checked if the addon still functions as I do not currently play World of Warcraft; but I vaguely recall mentions of the functionality of the /who command changing so it is likely this addon no longer functions. I will update this readme with a confirmation when I have free time to look into this.

I will attempt to document the functionality of the addon at a later date, once I have more time to read and understand the code.
